# DeepSSF ISBE2024
Additional details to accompany a poster titled 'Predicting animal movement with deepSSF: a deep learning step selection framework

# Animations of a simulated animal 'exploring' a landscape

## Habitat selection predictions
The simulated animal is in the centre of the landscape, and at each step the local landscape is evaluated for its suitability.

## Step selection predictions
The simulated animal is in the centre of the landscape, and at each step the local landscape is evaluated for its suitability, which is combined with the learned movement dynamics of the animal.
